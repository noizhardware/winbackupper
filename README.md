### script to automate and log directory backup

The script will copy a folder to another folder, in a subfolder named with date and time, and will log the operation in a plain text file.
Very simple, I just felt I needed this :)

_Usage:_
- Change "sourcedir" and "destdir" to match your wanted source and destination directories
- Use the option -s when launching the command to shutdown the computer after the backup
